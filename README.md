## Not maintained anymore
GameplayKit now has [it's own pathfinder component](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/GameplayKit_Guide/Pathfinding.html). You should probably use that one instead.

## Usage
Soon.

## Future
- 3D Map support
- More algorithms

## Things to note
- Best performance is achieved when using the Release Build Configuration
- I have not tested this on an iPhone 
- The demo is a mess, I'll clean that up soon

## License
Pathfinder is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.
